## pig

suboptimal accursed irc bot written (mostly) in bqn. it runs occasionally on 
[apionet](https://apionet.gh0.pw/).

this is like my first moderately large thing in any array language don't kill me please

this repository contains:
- `pig.sh`, a shell file make the connection and run the thing (check it before running)
- `pig.bqn`, that handles the requests and sends responses and stuff
- this

too many things are hardcoded now. i should change this
